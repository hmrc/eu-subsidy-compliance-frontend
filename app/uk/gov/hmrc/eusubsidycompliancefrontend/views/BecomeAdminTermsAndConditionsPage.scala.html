  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What are de minimis aid payments (less Customs Duty waivers)?</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
   De minimis aid payments (less Customs Duty waivers) could include subsidised contracts, loans or grants,
   from organisations like Invest NI and NI Direct. If you are unsure
   if an aid you claim is counted as de minimis aid payments (less Customs Duty waivers) you should contact the provider.
  </p>



  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is a single undertaking?</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
   HMRC needs to group together related businesses within a company
   or organisation into a 'single undertaking'. Businesses within an
   undertaking are identified by their EORI number.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">

   Every company may be structured differently. You may be a sole trader,
   a limited company or partnership. You may be a larger business, with subsidiary companies within the organisation.
   However a business is structured, we need to group all subsidiary or parent companies
   together. This is referred to as a single undertaking.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
   EORI number GB873554120329 will be the administrator for this single undertaking. The administrator is a business, not a person.

  </p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Declaration</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">I agree to the terms and conditions.</p>
